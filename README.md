A FizzBuzzOink-Implementation only in the for-loop-header in Java

This was a quick exercise to test the possibilities and was not meant as a serious solution. ;) 

## Rules 
List the integers from 1 to 100.
But for every multiple of 3 write _Fizz_, for multiples of 5 _Buzz_ and _Oink_ for multiples of 7.
